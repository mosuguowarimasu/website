      <h2>Why are we here?</h2>
      <p>AI is in your phone, your games, your social feeds – but most people never get taught what it actually is.  
         This educational experience will be a fun, five-minute tour that will allow you to decide for yourself:  
         <strong>Is AI a friend, a foe, or something in-between?</strong></p>

          <h3>Think</h3>
          <p>AI is software that can <strong>learn patterns</strong> from examples (photos, text, sounds) and then make predictions.</p>

    <section id="benefits">
      <h2>Three big benefits</h2>
      <ul class="benefit-list">
        <li><strong>Easy automation:</strong> Makes certain tasks be done faster and more efficient [1] Automation in AI can help boost productivity in workplaces such as production lines, where they can take over the more time-consuming and higher risk tasks, allowing human input to be better utilised in other areas of work. these forms of automation can also lessen the risk of human error and handle dangerous tasks that could pose a threat to human life. </li>
        <li><strong>Reducing human error:</strong> The use of Artificial intelligence can significantly reduce the risk of human error being produces, this is due to AI being developed based on information and data gathered, and creating algorithms that can detect potential errors before they happen. Some examples where AI can reduce human error include equipment piloted by AI, as well as massive data entry and processing.[5] </li>
        <li><strong>Ease of learning:</strong> It can make abstract concepts more understandable by generating an image on the subject [2] Based on AI-driven analytical data that gives insight into student performance and learning trends, it can design learning content based on individual student needs and learning styles. In addition, it can also provide students with immediate feedback, assisting students to assess their weaknesses and strengths.</li>
        <li><strong>Power saving:</strong> AI powered thermostat can make the climate control more efficient, lowering the power use at least by 23% [3] </li>
      </ul>

    <section id="risks">
      <h2>Three big risks</h2>
      <ul class="risk-list">
        <li><strong>Data bias:</strong> AI can be biased as it learns from data created by humans. If this data includes unfair patterns, stereotypes or inequalities, it can lead to the AI repeating these mistakes and producing a further bias, that can lead to unfair decision-making.[1]</li>
        <li><strong>Becoming too dependant:</strong> Overuse of AI in day-to-day tasks will lead to people not being as selfsufficient [2] For example, students or professionals that rely on AI to complete their work to pass a class or deliver a work product, which leads to a risk in losing their own ability to develop their own arguments and reasoning. Becoming too dependent on AI can also lead to health and safety concerns from medical professionals, using AI tools to check symptoms when someone is sick without consulting a medical professional can lead to delayed diagnosis.[6]</li>
        <li><strong>Deepfakes:</strong> Ai is scarely accurate generation of a specific content type can lead to high doubts in any information online [4] These pieces of media can then be used to trick people by spreading misinformation and promote bias. Not only that, but they can also be used in order to blackmail, for example someone could generate a deepfake of an individual saying something offensive, then spread it for monetary gain or to promote a hateful bias.</li>
